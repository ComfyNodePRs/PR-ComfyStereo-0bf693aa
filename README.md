# ComfyStereo
A very basic port of the stereoscopic script used in thygate/stable-diffusion-webui-depthmap-script

Most of the credit goes to them, and most of the rest to some LLMs.

The Stereo Image Node is a basic port from the Automatic1111 stereo script. In the current implementation it doesn't support image batches.
The LazyStereo node is another very basic stereo image generator. This node supports image batches.
